LinkedIn BQ:
1. I am a software engineer and I've worked in Bloomberg for more than 3 years. I work in a team called Order Analytics, and I am currently working on systems that produce analytical data for traders, and systems that deliver these data to multiple downstreams. On a daily basis, I am developing and maintaining many services written in C++ and some client-facing terminal UI in Javascript. The major project that I own is a system that renders realtime analytical data to traders that helps them making trading decisions and optimizing the return. We have more than 5k users at the moment. Another project is a system that computes transaction cost and risk based on volume estimation model, which is used more than 200 firms in the financial industry.

2. Why LinkedIn?
a. leading tech company
b. great user base -> millions of users are making billions of hits everyday -> engineering team
c. I have a lot friends working there and they speak highly about the engineering culture in LinkedIn. People are smart, positve, hardworking and most importantly easy to work with. I can clearly see their growth over the years. They have learnt so much from their experiences in LinkedIn as software engineer, and I believe if I could join, it would be a great chance for me as well.
