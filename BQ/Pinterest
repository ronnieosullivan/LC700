Pinterest BQ:
1. I am a software engineer and I've worked in Bloomberg for more than 3 years. I work in a team called Order Analytics, and I am currently working on systems that produce analytical data for traders, and systems that deliver these data to multiple downstreams. On a daily basis, I am developing and maintaining many services written in C++ and some client-facing terminal UI in Javascript. The major project that I own is a system that renders realtime analytical data to traders that helps them making trading decisions and optimizing the return. We have more than 5k users at the moment. Another project is a system that computes transaction cost and risk based on volume estimation model, which is used more than 200 firms in the financial industry.
